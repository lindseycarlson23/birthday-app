# The Birthday App

The Birthday App is a web app where users input their birthday to learn what historical events happened on their birthday and what the Billboard Top Songs were for the week they were born.

The Birthday App utilizes HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Javascript, Day.js, local browser storage, and 3rd party APIs.
